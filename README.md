# Connecting Dots Problem
An android project to make a canvas to connect 2 dots using different color using line.

# Full Description :-

Create a closed figure. When user touches the screen, a point will be created at that location. When user again touched at some other point on the screen then again a point will be created and a line will be drawn b/w the 1st and 2nd point. The line will have a random color. When user again touches the screen, again 3rd point will be created at the location of touch and a line will be drawn b/w the 2nd and 3rd point. Same procedure will go on for further points. If at any time user clicks on the 1st point then the path will get closed and user will not be able to create any other point. User can also “Undo” the steps using the Undo button.
